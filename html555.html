    <h1>features of html 5</h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Intro of audio and video: 
            Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their website. HTML5 video can use CSS and CSS3 to style the video tag. You can change the border, opacity, reflections, gradients, transitions, transformations, and even animations. HTML5 makes adding video super-fast and without having to build a video player. This saves time for the developer and offers the client a superior and more affordable solution.</li>
        <li>Vector Graphics-This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS. Vector graphics are scalable, easy to create and edit. It also supports interactivity and animation. Having a smaller file size makes transferring and loading graphics much faster on the web. Thatâ€™s the reason why many people prefer to use vector graphics.</li>
    <li>Header and Footer:
        With these new tags, there is no longer a need to identify the two elements with a <div> tag. Footer is placed at the end of the web page while Header is placed at the start of the web page. By using <header> and <footer> HTML5 elements, the browser will know what to load first and what to load later.</li>
    <li>Figure and Figcaption:
        HTML5 allows to use a <figure> element to mark up a photo in a document, and a <figcaption> element to define a caption for the photo. The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. This tag provides a container for content that is equivalent to a figure. It can be used to group a caption with one or more images, a block of code, or other content.</li>
    <li>Nav tag:
        The <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links. It is used for the part of an internet site that links to different pages at the website. The hyperlinks can be organized through a number of approaches. Common examples of the nav elements are menus, tables, contents, and indexes. This element makes it much easier to create a navigation menu, creates a neat horizontal menu of text links, and helps screen reading software to correctly identify primary navigation areas in the document.</li>  
     
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>html entitities</h2>
        <p>HTML entities are the reserved characters that are used in the HTML document. They are not present in your standard keyboard. They provide a wide range of characters, allowing you to add icons, geometric shapes, mathematical operators, and so on</p>
     <ol type="1">
        <li>&quot-quotation mark</li>
        <li>&apos-apostrophe</li>
        <li>&amp-ampersand</li>
        <li>&lt-less than</li>
        <li>&gt-greater than</li>
     </ol>
     <h1>web accesibility</h1>
     <p>When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use.

        Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. International web standards define what is needed for accessibility.</p>
    <h1>ways for improving accesibility inhtml</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the <button> element (and not a <div> element).</li>
    <li>The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).</li>
        <li>You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.</li>
<li>Always use a clear language, that is easy to understand. Also try to avoid characters that cannot be read clearly by a screen reader. For example:

    Keep sentences as short as possible
    Avoid dashes. Instead of writing 1-3, write 1 to 3</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h1>TAB INDEX</h1>
    <P>The tabindex attribute specifies the tab order of an element (when the "tab" button is used for navigating).

        The tabindex attribute can be used on any HTML element (it will validate on any HTML element. However, it is not necessarily useful).</P>
    <br>
    <h1>SEMANTIC TAGS</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>The <section> element defines a section in a document.</li>
        <li>The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

            An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.</li>
        <li>The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links</li>
        <li>The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section.</li>
        <li>The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h1>why semantic tags are imp</h1>
    <p>The are several advantages of using semantics tags in HTML:

        The HTML semantics refers to the tags that provide meaning to an HTML page rather than just presentation. It makes HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. 
        The semantic HTML tags help the search engines and other user devices to determine the importance and context of web pages.
        The pages made with semantic elements are much easier to read.
        It has greater accessibility. It offers a better user experience.</p>
